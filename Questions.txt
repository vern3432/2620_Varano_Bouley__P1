Should it account for repeats in the inventory 
should it delete from inventory if less than zero 
should an exception be thrown if more is being ordred than is avalible. 
        iF NOT, WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN 
        Give them whats avaliable? Only sell avalible items? Null out the order as a whole?
